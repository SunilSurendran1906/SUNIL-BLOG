      <h2>Importance of Cyber Security</h2>
      <img src="https://example.com/os_security_image.jpg" alt="Operating System Security"/>
      <p>Cyber security is crucial in today's interconnected world. It helps safeguard sensitive information, such as personal data, financial records, and intellectual property. It also ensures the reliability and availability of systems and services, protecting individuals, organizations, and even nations from potential harm caused by cyber attacks.</p>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Cyber Threats and Attacks</h2>
      <p>There are various types of cyber threats and attacks, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Malware: Software designed to harm or exploit systems, such as viruses, worms, and ransomware.</li>
        <li>Phishing: Attempting to deceive users into providing sensitive information, often through fraudulent emails or websites.</li>
        <li>Denial of Service (DoS): Overloading a system or network to make it unavailable to users.</li>
        <li>Social Engineering: Manipulating individuals to gain unauthorized access or divulge confidential information.</li>
        <li>Zero-day Exploits: Exploiting vulnerabilities in software before they are discovered and patched.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Module 1: Network Security</h2>
      <img src="https://www.cisco.com/c/dam/assets/swa/img/anchor-info/what-is-network-security-blog-banner-628x353.png" alt="Operating System Security"/>
      <p>Overview of network security concepts.</p>
      <section>
      <h2>Network Security Components</h2>
      <p>Network security comprises various components, including:</p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Firewalls:</strong> Firewalls are devices or software that monitor and control incoming and outgoing network traffic. They enforce security policies, filter malicious traffic, and prevent unauthorized access to the network.</li>
        <li><strong>Intrusion Detection Systems (IDS):</strong> IDSs monitor network traffic, looking for signs of suspicious or malicious activity. They detect and alert network administrators about potential security breaches.</li>
        <li><strong>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs):</strong> VPNs establish secure, encrypted connections over public networks. They allow remote users to access a private network securely and protect sensitive data during transmission.</li>
        <li><strong>Wireless Network Security:</strong> Wireless networks introduce additional security risks. Implementing security protocols such as Wi-Fi Protected Access (WPA) and strong authentication mechanisms help secure wireless communications.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Network Security Best Practices</h2>
      <p>To enhance network security, it is important to follow best practices, such as:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Implementing strong and unique passwords for network devices and user accounts.</li>
        <li>Regularly updating and patching network equipment and software to address known vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li>Enabling encryption protocols, such as Secure Sockets Layer (SSL) and Transport Layer Security (TLS), to secure data in transit.</li>
        <li>Enforcing strict access controls, including user authentication and authorization mechanisms.</li>
        <li>Monitoring network traffic and system logs to detect and respond to security incidents promptly.</li>
      </ul>

      <h2>Module 2: Operating System Security</h2>
      <img src="https://static.javatpoint.com/operating-system/images/operating-system-security.png" alt="Operating System Security"/>
      <p>Exploring secure operating system configurations.</p>
      <section>
      <h2>Secure Configuration</h2>
      <p>Securing the operating system starts with configuring it in a secure manner. This includes:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Enabling strong password policies and enforcing password complexity requirements.</li>
        <li>Disabling unnecessary services and features to reduce the attack surface.</li>
        <li>Configuring access controls to limit user privileges and restrict access to sensitive resources.</li>
        <li>Enabling and configuring auditing and logging mechanisms to monitor system activity.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>User Authentication and Access Control</h2>
      <p>User authentication and access control mechanisms are essential for operating system security. Key considerations include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Implementing strong authentication methods, such as two-factor authentication (2FA) or biometric authentication.</li>
        <li>Applying the principle of least privilege (PoLP), granting users only the necessary access rights and permissions.</li>
        <li>Regularly reviewing and updating user accounts, disabling or removing unused or compromised accounts.</li>
        <li>Implementing access control lists (ACLs) to control file and resource access.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Patch Management and Software Updates</h2>
      <p>Keeping the operating system up to date with the latest patches and software updates is crucial for security. This involves:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Regularly checking for and applying security patches and updates provided by the operating system vendor.</li>
        <li>Monitoring security advisories and vulnerability databases to stay informed about potential vulnerabilities.</li>
        <li>Using automated tools for patch management to streamline the update process.</li>
      </ul>
    </section>
    
    <section>
      <h2>Secure File Systems</h2>
      <p>Protecting the integrity and confidentiality of data stored on the operating system requires secure file system configurations:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Implementing access controls and file permissions to restrict unauthorized access to files and directories.</li>
        <li>Enabling file system encryption, such as BitLocker or FileVault, to protect sensitive data at rest.</li>
        <li>Implementing file integrity checking mechanisms, such as file hashing, to detect unauthorized modifications.</li>
      </ul>
